This project was created over the course of a semester, and consists of implementations of data structures and algorithms discussed in CSC316. 
It also includes JUnit test cases for all implementations, reaching at least 80% coverage of all classes. The project overal has 97% test coverage, 
with all tests passing successfully.
The list of included structures and algorithmes included is as follows:
