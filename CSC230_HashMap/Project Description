This program takes user commands to input and manipulate data, which is stored in a hash map. It can store integers, along with strings 
which are hashed using the Jenkings hash function. Lines are read from standard input, and valid commands consist of:
- set
  - takes a key and a value as parameters 
  - either adds the value to the map or replaces a value with the same key thats already in the map with the given value
- get
  - takes a key as a parameter
  - returns the value the given key, or prints "Undefined" if no value with that key exists
- remove
  - takes a key as a parameter
  - removes the value with the given key, or prints "Not in map" if no value with that key exists
- size
  - takes no parameters
  - returns the size of the map
